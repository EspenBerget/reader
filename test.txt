Test File for Screen Reader

This is a test file.

It is important to know that this text will not be presented normally, but will instead be shown one word at a time.
This is to aid in reading speed as one off the handicaps of our reading speed is the movement of the eye!

Hope you see that you are reading much faster now, and that this does not feel like too much of a loss.

The text is still available as a whole, so you can still read it when you like, but maybe read through it first like this.
